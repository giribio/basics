How to start with Jupyter, Python, Libs, Github and Models


1. The jupyter notebook in this repo will help you to install miniconda
only if Python 3.7 and Jupyter is alread installed in your computer (Linux/Windows/OSX)

2. conda helps you install other libraries mainly required for cheminformatics, analysis, machine learning, image analysis, SAR studies, forcefield analysis and many others including plotting graphs.

3. The codes in the notebook would be mandatory for any newbie or a good practice if you wanted the notebook to be used by anybody around the globe expecting they do not have any tools installed in thier computer.

Install the following before running cells in the Jupyter Notebook

Install Python 3.7.6

Windows  --  https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.6/python-3.7.6-amd64.exe

Mac OSX  --  https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.6/python-3.7.6-macosx10.9.pkg

Linux    --  Not required as it is preinstalled
